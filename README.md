<h1>Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation Demo</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a simple C++ program that walks the user through choosing a spacecraft and learning its orbital capabilities. The menu allows you to select a target orbit and will calculate the maximum payload you are able to carry. It also allows you to enter the mass of a payload and calculates which orbit(s) your spacecraft can reach with said payload. The program utilizes data structures such as maps to store data used in calculations. For the menu-driven aspect of the program, switch statements and while loops are used to provide input validation and a menu of options to the user.

ISP: <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XVicfVF.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt="Rocket Equation Steps"/>
<br />
The ISP (specific impulse) is the efficiency of your rocket engine. g is the gravitational constant  
<br />
<br />
Mass Ratio: <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/70YFbvd.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt="Rocket Equation Steps"/>
<br/>
m0/m1 is the mass ratio (initial mass/final mass). <br />
The ln is to mathematically describe how the velocity of the rocket changes as it burns fuel (mass).
<br />
<br />
Delta V <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5pQ81Fv.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt="Rocket Equation Steps"/>
<br />
Î”V is the change in velocity of the rocket. 
Tells us how much maneuvering a spacecraft can do such as getting into orbit.
