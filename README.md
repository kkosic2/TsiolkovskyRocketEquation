<h1>Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation Demo</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a simple C++ program that walks the user through choosing a spacecraft and learning its orbital capabilities. The menu allows you to select a target orbit and will calculate the maximum payload you are able to carry. It also allows you to enter the mass of a payload and calculates which orbit(s) your spacecraft can reach with said payload. The program utilizes data structures such as maps to store data used in calculations. For the menu-driven aspect of the program, switch statements and while loops are used to provide input validation and a menu of options to the user.
